1.Objective:This project aims to study the factors affecting food production from the perspective of climate change. Many factors affect grain yield, including but not limited to grain type, temperature, humidity, geographical environment (latitude and longitude), the presence of natural disasters, etc. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions can affect global temperature through the greenhouse effect, and plant growth will also be affected by greenhouse gases. In this project, a multi-faceted data set with different sources were used for data mining. Therefore, it is necessary to match the years and countries of different data resources during the study to obtain relatively accurate results. There is a risk of inaccurate results due to incomplete data attributes in this project.


2.Development Environmentï¼šThe project environment of this project is Amazon Web Services, Jupyter notebook is used to complete the writing of pyspark code, and Github is used to store the code of this project implementation.
